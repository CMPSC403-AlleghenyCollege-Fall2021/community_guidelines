### Team work

Members of this class must show respect for all peers as learners and team members, allow peers to voice their opinions and questions, and read, understand, and follow all parts of this code of Conduct. Every team member needs to be actively and cooperatively involved with the projects at hand. This will ensure the flow of questions, ideas, and thoughts in a respectful manner. Our project at its root includes participation, candidness and insightful collaboration. Participating in project discussion means engaging in conversation, not just answering questions. The goal here is to show up and truly be all there. The majority of individuals in a team should agree on a given decision before the project is implemented. It should be made with supporting evidence that shows that the decision is productive. When unsure about making a decision it is a good idea to defer to a technical leader or the professor. One should reach out to other teams whom the choice will influence. Teams will determine how long a decision will take to implement. Members of this class will resolve conflicts before they become severe by engaging in respectful conversations, with the course instructor having final say in how severe conflicts should be resolved.
